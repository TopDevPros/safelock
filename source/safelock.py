    Multiprocess-safe locks.

    Safelock server for denova.os.lock. Requires "pip3 install denova safelog".

    Written because none of the standard python locking mechanisms work
    reliably.

    We do not queue requests or have multiple workers because that would
    just create another concurrency issue. The client must retry as needed.

    To do: Drop privs
